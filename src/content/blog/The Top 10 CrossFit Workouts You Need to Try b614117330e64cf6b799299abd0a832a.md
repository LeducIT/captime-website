# The Top 10 CrossFit Workouts You Need to Try

## **The Fran: A Classic CrossFit Workout That Packs a Punch**

The Fran workout is a classic CrossFit workout that has been around since the early days of the sport. It is a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workout that is designed to pack a punch and challenge even the fittest athletes. The workout consists of two exercises – thrusters and pull-ups – that are performed in a specific sequence for a set number of repetitions. The goal is to complete the workout as quickly as possible while maintaining good form and technique.

To help athletes keep track of their progress and stay on track with their timing, many CrossFit gyms use specialized timers such as the TABATA Timer, AMRAP Timer, EMOM Timer, and HIIT+ Interval Timer. These timers allow athletes to set specific work and rest intervals, making it easier to push themselves to their limits and get the most out of their workouts.

In addition to the specialized timers, there are also other tools that can be used to enhance the CrossFit experience, such as the For Time Timer, which allows athletes to shout "time" or "stop" when they finish a workout, the SALLY Timer, which is used for the popular "Bring Sally Up" workout, and the Fight gone bad workout, which is a challenging circuit that incorporates a variety of exercises.

For those who are serious about their CrossFit training, there are even video timers available for the CrossFit Games, which allow athletes to track their progress and compare their times to other competitors. With so many tools and resources available, the Fran workout and other CrossFit workouts are more accessible and challenging than ever before.

## **The Murph: A Hero Workout That Will Push Your Limits**

CrossFit enthusiasts are always on the lookout for new and challenging workouts, and The Murph is one that stands out from the rest. This hero workout is named after Navy Lieutenant Michael Murphy, who was killed in action in Afghanistan in 2005. The Murph is a grueling workout that tests your endurance, strength, and mental toughness.

The Murph follows the HIIT (high-intensity interval training) format, which involves short bursts of intense exercise followed by periods of rest or active recovery. This type of training has been proven to be effective in burning fat, building muscle, and improving cardiovascular health. The workout consists of a 1-mile run, 100 pull-ups, 200 push-ups, 300 squats, and another 1-mile run, all done for time.

To make it even more challenging, CrossFitters often add weights or wear a weight vest during the workout. They also use tools like the TABATA Timer, AMRAP Timer, EMOM Timer, and HIIT+ Interval Timer to keep track of time and reps. The SALLY Timer and Fight gone bad are other popular timers used for CrossFit workouts. The Video timer for CrossFit games is also a useful tool for tracking progress and competing with others.

Overall, The Murph is a hero workout that will push your limits and leave you feeling accomplished. It requires dedication, discipline, and mental toughness, but the results are worth it. If you're up for the challenge, give The Murph a try and see how far you can push yourself.
