When choosing a CrossFit timer, you need to consider your needs and budget. There are different types of timers available, including basic timers, multi-functional timers, and video timers.

Some video timers are also designed for CrossFit games, allowing you to compete with other CrossFit enthusiasts around the world.

In conclusion, choosing the right CrossFit timer depends on your needs and budget.
