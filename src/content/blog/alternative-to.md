Keeping track of your reps or rounds is one of the most vital things to achieve your fitness goals, no matter where you perform your workouts. This way, you can add measurability to your workouts and structure your fitness regimen. The best way to achieve all this is to use a timer clock that helps you micro-schedule your movements in the middle of your gym activity.

Timer clocks come equipped with visual and auditory signals that can tell when to start or stop your movements. Some modern-day timers offer even more. One of the most popular options in this regard is the Rogue Echo Gym Timer, which consists of dedicated hardware running a specialized timer application. In the latter part of this post, we will describe the best alternative to Rogue Gym Timer. For now, let’s have a brief overview of why you should use a gym timer.

## **What Does A Typical Gym Timer Do?**

- **_It Helps Manage Time._**

Athletes with busy schedules usually want to perform their workouts only for a limited number of minutes in a day. Other fitness enthusiasts do not want to waste their time scrolling on their phone screens when spacing out between reps or rounds. Both these groups of people can benefit from gym timers. These timers send timely signals to notify you when to start or end a particular set or take a break. In the end, they help you avoid uselessly lengthy sessions.

- **_Effective Interval Training_**

Interval training refers to exercises that improve your cardiovascular health by increasing your heart rate. This fitness regimen involves high-intensity movements spaced at minimal resting periods. Hence, using a timer becomes crucial in such workouts as it notifies you when to start your workout, when to stop, and when to start over. Without a timer preset on interval training settings, it will be hard for you to keep track of when to begin and end your workout.

- **_Measuring Progress_**

Counting the number of reps you can perform in a set is the primary way to measure your progress in any given workout. Unfortunately, it is easier said than done if you perform AMRAP or other forms of HIIT without the support of a preset timer. These timers help you use the time to measure your movements. The best thing about these timers is they take care of the counting process, helping you focus on your movements in a better way.
