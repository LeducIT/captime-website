# How to Use Captime's TABATA Timer for Maximum Results

## **Understanding the Basics of TABATA Training**

TABATA training has become increasingly popular in the world of fitness. It is a form of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) that involves short bursts of intense exercise followed by periods of rest. This type of training was named after Japanese scientist Dr. Izumi Tabata, who discovered the benefits of this method while working with the Japanese speed skating team. 

TABATA training involves performing eight rounds of exercises, each lasting 20 seconds with 10 seconds of rest in between. This is a great way to improve cardiovascular fitness, increase endurance, and burn fat. It is also an excellent way to challenge yourself and push your limits. 

CrossFit enthusiasts have embraced TABATA training as a way to enhance their workouts. The TABATA Timer, AMRAP Timer, EMOM Timer, HIIT Interval Timer, For Time Timer (shout TIME or STOP), SALLY Timer, Fight gone bad, and Video timer for CrossFit games are all tools that can be used to help with TABATA training. 

In summary, understanding the basics of TABATA training is essential for anyone who wants to improve their fitness level.
