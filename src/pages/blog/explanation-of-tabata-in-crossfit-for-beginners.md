# Explanation of Tabata in CrossFit For Beginners

The name of this training is due to Dr. Izumi Tabata This is a Japanese researcher who was looking for a method to be able to have a complete workout in a short time. With the 20-10 interval, he delivered a workout that showed that this form of High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) could make a difference, increasing both anaerobic capacity and maximal aerobic power.

As a result of his research, a more specific study was conducted into the power of this HIIT training. The outcome of this study: Tabata improves your stamina. With a workout of 20 minutes in which you do a total of 4, you will burn between 240 to 360 calories.

## How Does This Work?

The Tabata workout is a 4-minute workout consisting of 8 intervals. The intention is that you do a certain exercise reasonably intensively for 20 seconds and then you rest for 10 seconds, then you work again for 20 seconds for a total of 8 rounds. You can determine the intensity for this training yourself, but for a good training effect, you must ensure that the intensity is always the same.

## Effects on Energy Systems

The Tabata Protocol appeared to improve two of the body's major energy systems. Tabata workout targets the anaerobic energy system, which is responsible for high-intensity, short exercises like sprinting. In addition, it targets the aerobic energy system, which is used during endurance activities like low-intense and slow running. 

Both moderate-intensity and steady-state cardio target the aerobic system in traditional interval training. They don't always improve your anaerobic system, however, unless you step outside your comfort zone. Using high-intensity interval training with a rest period shorter than the work period can still target both systems, as Dr. Tabata found. Thus, it's a very effective way to boost the efficiency of both athletes and average exercisers.

## Example Tabata Training

We have included an example training for you, so you can see how this training works in practice. You can do this Tabata as a warm-up, for example. You do the following 4 exercises twice.

* Jumping Jacks
* Shoulder Taps
* Knee lifts
* Jumping rope

You also have countless other options. For example, 8 rounds with the same exercise over and over, such as: push up, burpees, squats, sit-ups, push up to plank, and so on. You can also do a different exercise every round, 2 exercises alternately, 4 times one and 4 times the other, etc. the possibilities are endless.

## Summary

Tabata workout offers significant performance benefits in a shorter time frame. But as the intensity intervals require all-out efforts.  itâ€™s important to get the basics right first. Beginners should start with lighter interval training and gradually work their way up to this level of intensity. Try 20 seconds on/10 seconds off with easier exercises such as walking or low impact moves like running in place, step touches, or knee lifts.
