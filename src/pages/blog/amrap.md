This workout protocol has endless possibilities since you can manipulate exercises and allotted time in many ways. However, most AMRAP workouts are based on high-intensity circuit training or high-intensity interval training.

Hence, there are a few things you should keep in mind about AMRAP.

## **Workouts That Focus On Rounds**

Here are a few factors to keep in mind about exercises that focus on rounds.

### ***Shorter Timeframes***

Since this training isn’t based on reps, it can tire you out more quickly. And, performing only one exercise multiple times instead of switching between different workouts can be even more exhausting. Having that said, the timeframe you set for a specific exercise depends on your endurance and ability.

### ***Interval Training Protocols***

Some Tabata exercises use AMRAP protocols related to reps. A Tabata exercise is usually based on eight intervals, each consisting of 20 seconds of workout and 10 seconds of rest. Now, the number of reps you perform during each interval is entirely up to you. Generally, you have to achieve as many reps as possible. But remember, not all Tabata exercises follow AMRAP protocols, so choose your workout wisely.

You can even change the length of the workout and rest time frames to accommodate a specific number of repetitions. But again, you have to complete as many reps as possible during a specific period.

## **Workouts That Focus On Repetition**

Here is what to expect when you perform a single workout based on the intervals.

### ***Circuit Training Protocols***

You have to complete as many rounds as you can in a specific period when performing exercises based on circuits. Following this protocol, you will need to perform multiple exercises one after another with very little rest between rounds. The exercises you perform during this type of AMRAP may include push-ups, air squats, renegade rows, and single-leg deadlifts.

### ***A Fixed Number Of Repetitions Per Workout***

AMRAP based on repetitions involves performing each exercise for a specific timeframe. On the other hand, AMRAP based on rounds involves performing all exercises in a circuit during a fixed period. To perform a circuit-based workout, you first have to determine the number of reps you perform during each workout. For instance, you can perform 10 push-ups, 8 renegade rows, 8 single-leg deadlifts, and 15 squats during a single round. You can repeat this entire circuit until the allotted time expires.

### ***Longer Timeframes***

Since you will be performing multiple exercises instead of one, the timeframe will undoubtedly be longer with this AMRAP protocol. This timeframe can last up to 5, 10, 15, or even 20 minutes. The goal of this protocol is to complete as many circuits as possible.

## **Remember, It Is More About Form Than Speed.**

While completing a greater number of rounds or reps makes an AMRAP-based workout more effective, maintaining good form is equally important. A compromised workout form can even cause injuries aside from being non-efficacious.

## **Final Words**

With the help of AMRAP exercises, you can measure changes and improvements in your fitness. Having that said, keeping track of the allotted time plays a vital role. That’s where you can consider incorporating app-based timers that give you an alert when the time is up for a round or rep. With the help of these timers, you can track the number of intervals or rounds you perform during your workout.

In the end, you can use the [Captime](http://onelink.to/captime) app to allot time for your AMRAP and other workouts. The best thing about this app is its ease of use. It's simple options help you start the timer of your choice on the go.
