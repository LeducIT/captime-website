Every week competitors perform the workouts and submit their scores online before a specified time.
This should be supported by either video like in [Captime](http://onelink.to/captime) of their workouts or validations by a CrossFit affiliate.

In every event, the competitors are ranked according to their performance.
They gain points awarded directly corresponding to their rank.
The winner is the one with the lowest cumulative points over the course of the Open.

The 2022 CrossFit Games season will begin with the worldwide NOBULL CrossFit Games Open on Feb. 24, 2022. 
Open registration starts Jan. 13, 2022.

The Open will be the first step toward qualification for the 2022 NOBULL CrossFit Games.
