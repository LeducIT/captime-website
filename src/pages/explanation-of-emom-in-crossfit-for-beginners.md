# How Does It Work?

EMOM is the abbreviation for "Every Minute on the Minute". In this particular CrossFit variant, which is extremely popular with the top athletes in this discipline, you perform a different exercise every minute. The special thing about it: The number of repetitions for the individual exercises is predetermined. If it takes you less than 60 seconds for the repetitions, you rest until the full minute and then start the next exercise. The faster you can do the repetitions, the more rest you have. That not only sounds very motivating. But It is!

# Train Endurance And Strength With EMOM

With the appropriate selection of exercises, you can decide for yourself what you want to work on. If you want to improve your aerobic and anaerobic endurance, you can do jump rope, knee raises, burpees, jumping jacks, and mountain climbers. If you value strength more, you can do push-ups, plank variations, air squats, pull-ups, and the thrusters that are so popular with cross-fitters. But you can also combine strength and endurance very well.

# Realistic Rep Counts

Depending on your fitness level, you can vary an EMOM workout. It is best for beginners to start with a maximum ten-minute program. Advanced users and cracks can also train for up to 30 minutes. Realistic repetition numbers are important for individual exercises. It can be frustrating if you can't complete them in 60 seconds. A little experience is required here. If you can speak English, you will find a whole range of training examples for different fitness levels here.

# The Right Technique When You Are Tired

As you can imagine, EMOM is a big challenge for the body. Nevertheless, pay attention to a good and correct technique in all exercises. While this should go without saying, as fatigue increases, even squats can become a challenge. It is best to train under supervision, with a partner, or in a group. Then you can correct each other. If the technique suffers, you have to reduce the number of repetitions. What can also happen with EMOM is that you go into forced breathing. This cannot always be avoided with extreme exertion. Try to breathe normally anyway.
